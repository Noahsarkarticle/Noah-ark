How old were you when you discovered that Noah’s ark wasn’t a myth but rather a recount of a true biblical event that changed the whole of planet history.

The story of Noah also gives a vivid account of what might have happened to other species of Humans.

It also offers explanation to what might have caused the splitting of the planet continents.

The origin of demons & that of the fallen angels can be found written in a scroll, the Dead Sea scroll (the book of enoch).

The book of Enoch was have been referenced in the book of Jude 1:14—15.

### Picture of book of Enoch:

According to some scholars it was believed to have formed the world view of the early christians & Jews during the time of Jesus.

Enoch (Grand father to Noah) is believed to have walked with God and wrote many revelations about Heaven, Hell and happenings around his time including some end time events.

One of these is the story of the Watchers (fallen angels) which interbreeding with humans gave birth to mutant breeds of Giant human hybrid called the Nephilims.

These Giants were so huge that they grew to be as tall as oak trees…but these aren’t your ordinary Guinness book of record giants…

The tallest man that ever lived was believed to be far too little compared to these Nephilims.

Noah’s story also gives an account to what happened to the dinosaurs.

### Picture of Dinosaurs dying of asphyxiation:

Most of the story of mythological creatures, and mighty men of old all take their roots from the old world (time of Noah) before the flood.

Imagine a world where there are 12 foot giants roaming about, dinosaurs, monstrous looking creatures and strange species of humans all roaming.

Because of the activities of these anukuli (fallen angels) God’s beautiful creation was altered and in order for God to restore peace and order and bring in our messiah Jesus Christ to save us from all our sin…

Noah (a homo sapiens) found grace in the eye of the Lord and was to build an ark under the Lord’s Guidance

A big ark big enough to save himself, his family and the pairs of animals he was told to bring.

Unfortunately Noah was mocked despite his warnings to the people of his time who refused to enter and decided to party and merry instead.

Today in our time our ark is our personal lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
